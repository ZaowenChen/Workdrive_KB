2.1.2. Phantas light display logic
Enhance the ability of lighting interaction and improve the user's perception of the robot's state.
Priority of light display: Abnormal state > Normal state of workstation/charging dock > Robot needs manual assistance > Normal state of robot > Other states, high priority light color will be displayed firstly.
2.1.3. AIO Expansion of emergency stop and recovery scenarios
In the previous version, if the robot is in emergency stop status, the self-recovery will be automatically triggered after a certain period of time (Some models with rotating arrows on the emergency stop button do not support this function.). Compared with the previous version, AIO1.2 emergency stop self-recovery function policy has made the following adjustments:
Phantas: In AIO1.1 and previous versions, only trigger self-recovery after pressing the emergency stop button in the task is updated to being configurable:
Trigger Self-recovery only after the emergency stop button is pressed in a task
[Default] Emergency stop self-recovery can be triggered in any status.
40/50 model: To trigger self-recovery after pressing the emergency stop button only during running task in AIO1.1 and earlier versions is updated to being configurable:
[Default] Trigger Self-recovery only after pressing the emergency stop button during running a task
Emergency stop self-recovery can be triggered in any status
If you need to configure this setting, please contact the administrator.
2.1.4. Hotspot switch configuration is supported on the robot
Hotspot switch is supported (Switch is turned on by default in AIO1.2, and the status retained after restarting).

2.2. Health alarm related optimization
2.2.1. The suction duct blockage alarm can be automatically cleared once
When the robot has alarm 10041 (air suction pipe is blocked, please clean the air filter in time, clean the squeegee inlet (if any), and the garbage in the air suction pipe.),it will be automatically cleared once when the timed task/scheduled task/temporary task starts again (continue the task does not need to be cleared). If the air suction pipe is blocked again during the new task, the alarm will be generated, and the clear operations need to be done in time.
2.2.2. AIO1.2 supports reminder of No Daily Robot Maintenance
Phantas supports reminders when the daily cleaning action of the cleaner is not detected for a long time. There are two levels of alarms:
Default alarm: ""The robot cleaning parts have not been cleaned for a long time, please clean them in time."" By default, this alarm does not affect the task running.
More stringent alarm (need to contact the administrator to set): According to the special requirements of some customers, you can also contact the administrator to turn on the more stringent alarm ---- ""Robot cleaning parts have not been cleaned for a long time, please finish the daily clearance as soon as possible"". When the robot detects that the daily cleaning action has not been performed for 32 hours, this alarm will be triggered, the automatic task of the robot will be stopped, and alarm will not disappear until the robot is detected to enter the maintenance mode or cleaner performs the daily clearance.
2.2.3. Subdivide the cause of Phantas dock failure alarms
Three new sub-division alarms for the cause of Phantas dock failure have been added, which is convenient for users to handle as required: 
If the charging dock is detected to be unpowered or moved, please move the charging dock back to its original position and confirm that the charging dock power is turned on; 
If the position of the charging dock is detected to be moved, please move the charging dock back to the original position; 
The robot charging pole plate is detected with dust, please wipe it and try again.
2.3. Maintenance mode optimization
AIO1.1 introduced a new maintenance mode, but according to customer feedback, after exiting the maintenance mode, customer may forget to reinstall components such as rolling brush back sometimes. In order to avoid the above operation issues, the device detection function is added when exiting the maintenance mode. If components are detected that are not installed back to the robot, a reminder will pop up.
2.4. OTA related optimization
An ""Upgrade icon"" is added in the navigation bar of Robot screen: when there is a downloaded version to be upgraded in the robot, the ""upgrade icon"" will be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen; Click the ""Upgrade icon"" to pop up the ""Upgrade now"" window.
2.5. Spot cleaning optimization
AIO1.1 version introduced a new upgrade of spot cleaning, active cleaning functions. On this basis, AIO1.2 improves the success rate and accuracy rate of various types of garbage detection and cleaning by optimizing the algorithm, and improves the robot performance. There is no change in functional usage.
2.6. Efficiency priority mode and coverage priority mode
For SC50 and Phantas robots, on the basis of the original default mode, new efficiency priority mode and coverage priority mode are introduced to provide customers to select more robot’s performance modes according to the scene application or customer’s preference.
Default mode: The robot behavior is the same as the previous version. If no modification is made after the upgrade, the robot will automatically select the default mode.
If you want to change it to efficiency priority mode or coverage priority mode, please contact the administrator. The features of the two modes are described as follows:
If the efficiency priority mode is selected (currently only available for SC50 robots): the robot behavior will be more radical, faster acceleration and deceleration, and give up the blank(unclean) area below 1㎡, so as to achieve higher cleaning efficiency. Tested in the supermarket, cleaning efficiency increased by more than 30% after enabling the efficiency priority mode (only specific experimental site, does not represent all site conditions);
If the coverage priority mode is selected (available for SC50 and Phantas robots): the robot will prefer to reduce the blank(unclean) area in the cleaning process, but the cleaning efficiency will be reduced accordingly.
2.7. Other algorithms optimization
The content in this section is capability improvement only, deployment and interface changes are not involved.
2.7.1. Pedestrian comity and voice reminder
Based on the pedestrian recognition and trajectory prediction technology introduced in the previous version, AIO1.2 optimizes the pedestrian interaction logic. When pedestrian obstructs the trajectory of the robot or is about to enter the trajectory of the robot, robot firstly stops, and plays the voice reminder ("" Hello, please make way, I want to pass/I want to charge /... ""), waits for the pedestrian to leave before continuing to perform the task according to the original route, in order to minimize the impact on the clean path and avoid blank area. If the pedestrian still blocks the route after waiting for a period of time (3 to 30 seconds, depending on the type of pedestrian blocking and the type of task), then re-plan path and detour.
This feature currently has the following limitations, please note that these will be optimized in future version:
In some cases, it cannot be triggered
If the only path that the robot can take is blocked by the stationary pedestrian and the surrounding obstacles, there is a probability that the pedestrian voice reminder will not be triggered, but the general reminder voice will be triggered after getting stuck ("" Excuse me, please make way "").
If the robot enters a narrow lane and there is a stationary pedestrian at the end of the narrow lane blocking the exit, there is a high probability that the voice reminder cannot be triggered, and the robot directly performs the narrow lane escape logic.
VC40 does not have the function of visual recognition of pedestrians, so the above interaction cannot be triggered for stationary pedestrians, can be triggered for dynamic pedestrians, and the success rate is less than SC50/Phantas.
For sitting person, SC50/Phantas can recognize and trigger voice reminders, so in the scene of many stationary people (such as office area), this function may cause confusion and affect the efficiency of robot running; In addition, the scene with clothes on the chair is difficult to distinguish from people sitting on the chair in the robot perspective, and it may easy to misdetect and trigger voice reminders.
2.7.2. Narrow lane escape strategy optimization, reduce backward behavior
In AIO1.2 version, the following two strategies are applied to reduce the backward behaviors when the robot is stuck in the narrow lane, so as to avoid residual water on the floor:
In real-time automatic coverage task, the paths that are too narrow for the robot to turn around in are avoided during path planning;
(Only for SC50) If the robot has entered the narrow path, due to new obstacles, the unstable perception result and other factors caused to be stuck, the previous version tended to escape backward, currently the robot prefers to escape forward.
2.8. New function of gate control
This version officially supports the robot to connect the gate control through Lora, control the gate switch, and achieve the function of passing the gate, and provides a Gausium Navi APP productive deployment to avoid the major inconvenience of FAE manually entering the gate data, and manually re-entering the data after the version upgrade.
2.9. Phantas/40/50 elevator calling process optimization
Previous version: The robot will release the elevator control after completing the exiting, switching task map and arriving the waiting area.
Current AIO1.2: When the robot completes the exit, it releases the elevator control. It is expected that the PNC part of the elevator control time can be reduced by 33%-50% (from 2-3s to 1-2s).
2.10. Phantas supports water tank level information notification
The non-transparent design of the Phantas water tank makes it impossible to see the real-time liquid level information directly when refilling water, resulting in overflow of the water, which may damage the internal components of the robot possibly. To solve this issue, a new warning of the Phantas water tank liquid level announcement is added to:
When the head cover of the robot is open, and the opening time lasts for 10s (configurable), the current water level information of the water tank will be announced once; If the sewage tank is full, it will play ""sewage tank full"" once, otherwise it will not announce the sewage tank information;
When the robot head cover is open, and the liquid level value is detected to change after opening: start circulating the current liquid level value of the water tank (playing interval 5s, configurable), when the robot head cover is closed, stop voice announcement.
Note: If there are false alarm on site, you can set up the related parameter to control whether the notification is triggered. The setting is turned on by default. When it is turned off, all relevant voice content will not be played.","Release Notes","Gaussian","S1","1.2","","Other","Unknown","Firmware","Engineer","Low","Active","Internal","light display, health monitoring, maintenance","human","0","2025-10-07 19:17:32"

The version recommends updating the scope

Compatible models: 50 complete units V4.1 and below x86 platform
40 V1.6.1及以下 RK

Key features:
What's new
Cleaning preference - only 50 adapted

In the version, the cleaning parameters are preset according to the historical configuration parameters of each scene

In the Combined Task editing page, the selection of cleaning mode and parameter preference has been added, but only if the correct scene is selected on the map editing page
At the same time, a global setting button has been added at the top, which allows you to edit the cleaning mode and parameter preferences in the combined task at one time

其中，⾃定义参数偏好为APP上所⼿动设定的设备参数

The needs of the scene
After clicking to enter, you can view the status of the roller brush lifting or lowering, and at the same time, you can control the lifting and lowering status, which is convenient for different daily clearances

Inside the hovering ball, a ""Brush Replacement"" button has been added
The roller brush can be lifted and lowered in a controlled manner

According to the actual use feedback on the site, the automatic lowering function of Nissin roller brush has been optimized

2.1.3 Optimization of the automatic lowering function of Nissin roller brush - suitable for 40 and 50

Summoning Cleaning was temporarily closed due to insufficient ability to inspect and deal with dirt and failed to avoid functional misunderstandings
2.1.2 Summon Cleaning Function Turned Off - Only 50 is adapted


Perform in detection or brute force mode
Regardless of the cleaning mode associated with a subtask, if a scheduled task or a temporary task is bound to patrol or forceful cleaning, the task will be patrolled
mode to proceed


That is, if the subtask is bound to the sweeping mode, and the scheduled task or temporary task is bound to the cleaning mode, the actual task is based on the sweeping mode

The cleaning mode bound to subtasks is higher than that bound to scheduled tasks and temporary tasks, except for patrol and power modes
Clean mode priority

If the cleaning effect of the two levels is not up to standard, you can continue to use customization, and then match the reflow analysis of the set parameters and scenes

There are some differences in the parameters of the three levels of strong and gentle standard for different scenes, different cleaning modes, and you can choose standard or strong on site, if you are strong standard

Again, the corresponding button is still retained in the drop-down menu
After clicking enter, the roller brush will be automatically lowered, and if you need to lift it, you can click the corresponding button

The specific scenarios are as follows:

Configured as 3. For the 40 1.6.1 model with impact avoidance Hall sensor, it is set to 3 directly from the factory
For machines that leave the factory with the complete machine version 4.1.1 or later, or machines that have undergone Hall technical modifications before 4.1.1, you need to device_type the 11th position
scenery
In other words, the most common practice of the cleaner is: after the machine is stopped, it will be cleared every day. In essence, it covers the field of task pause, machine charging, etc
Spot for Nissin, because there is no absolute logic for disassembly and assembly, resulting in the cleaner having to push the machine out of the charging pile/workstation and then perform Nissin
2. Sometimes the cleaner will pull the robot out of the charging pile/workstation manually and then perform daily cleaning, sometimes it will not pull out the charging pile/workstation, and push the machine to a suitable place⾏
Find the robot, click to end the task and then manually push it to a suitable place, but there are exceptions, and the cleaning will also suspend the task after cutting the manual
1. The cleaner is accustomed to seeing the machine at the charging pile or workstation and starts to perform daily cleaning on the robot. But in the cleaning Nissin training, there is also a full audience
personnel
Background: After research and interviews, it was determined that the timing of Nissin on site was changeable and complex, and the existing functions could not serve Nissin well
When the task is suspended and the machine is charging, it can still adapt to the lifting function of the roller brush Nissin lowering and lifting

3. Precautions (important).

In order to ensure the cleaning effect, the cleaning preference function-502 needs to be gradually redeployed on site

40 support for new IR stickers, which need to be deployed gradually

40 New IR Stickers Deployed SOP:

40 New IR Sticker Verification Situation: 



50 The deep learning recognition function is no longer suitable for Intel Neural Sticks, and machines with related functions need to be used at home and abroad, and go through the R&D and technological transformation process4

The new anti-collision plan of the roller brush Nissin needs to be trained on on-site cleaning, and the most convenient improvements have been made at present, and at the same time it is confirmed that the anti-collision door switch has been technically changed, and there is no risk of false detection on the site
Need to change the device type from 11 digits to 3
so that security-related functions can take effect5

40 Support CAN communication battery and CAN communication battery OTA, if you want to OTA CAN battery, you need to upgrade twice,
Only 1.51.6 and 1.6.1 PRO800 3.1 models6

40 supports 1.6 and 1.6.1 self-developed in-wheel motor driver OTA, if you want to OTA the in-wheel motor driver, you need to upgrade twice7

50 narrow road new strategy, measured 90cm can pass stably, 40 measured 80cm can stably pass ----40 70cm?8

40 has not yet done 485CAN self-adaptation, and after technical modification, it needs to be manually corrected on the basis of the original SOP
/device/mcu/battery_type The advanced parameters are adjusted to 1 （0 It is 485 communication, 1 is CAN communication, otherwise it does not take effect）

40 If the CV recognition function is to be used on site (40 supports the identification of stairs, escalators and pools in Chaolin Square), it is necessary to calibrate on site 
https://gaussian.yuque.com/perception/documents/fnp3v4kbn4ghudpa?singleDoc# 
""40 - Forward Calibration SOP"". 


@Kongkailing10

CV recognition has certain requirements for light, and black objects are not supported at night. Carpets, wires, floor mats, escalators, stairs, etc. support half-light scenes at night, and nighttime lighting below a certain threshold cannot be recognized. At night, carpets, floor mats, and wires are too close to the color of the ground to miss the test. 11

The 40 machine and the 50 v3.7 model have blind spots, and there is a probability of falling down the stairs by relying only on CV recognition when driving in U-bends and welts. 12

After the turnstile is upgraded, you need to manually update file 13

40 began to support virtual SOC14

DNS optimization ensures that the local DNS cache works properly. The elevator control HTTP interface is changed to HTTP 1.1 long connection interface. It has been merged

The original SOP no longer needs to be manually executed15

40 The technical transformation of the battery no longer needs to adjust the advanced parameters, as long as the device_type can be adjusted according to the original SOP16

The traffic width of the 40 hotel scene is 700mm, and the default width of other scenes is 800mm17

The machine is not running smoothly, and the alarm frequency should be too high, which has been changed to buried point 18

https://gaussian.yuque.com/vhfwq2/zc0zl8/wrikiuemk88vomlu?singleDoc# 
""Add Custom Cleaning Mode SOP"" can be changed19

The hotfix1 driver version is already equipped with battery firmware 20 for 3.7/1.3/5.7

Fixed the logic of the roller brush stall detection, after the stall, the machine will lift the roller brush to detect whether it is stalled again, increasing the accuracy of the stall detection21
 
The version supports 3.7/1.3 battery firmware OTA upgrade, and does not support 5.7 battery firmware OTA upgrade, on-site
Positive plate battery vehicles can only be upgraded without driver version 22

 North America, Japan and South Korea have to use upper computerswifi,It is necessary to manually shield the lower computer wifi,The version involvedM9-00-7,M9-00-8,M10-00- 0,M10-00-1,tangible sop:

Jira turn demand:
SELLSERVIC-72025
(for 40 product lines only) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69 

Problem phenomenon: Robots in non-North America are not equipped with antennas when shipped, but the software uses the host computer WiFi by default, resulting in poor WiFi Internet access signal for these robots

Background: 1

According to the certification requirements of North America, Japan and South Korea, robots shipped in these regions need to use certified WiFi, so we have introduced the WiFi function of the host computer in the hardware, that is, the WiFi module is pasted on the industrial computer, and the antenna is installed, and the software controls these robots to use the host WiFi to network (
ROBOTPLAN-1756 
ROBOTPLAN-2208 
）2

For shipments outside of North America, Japan and South Korea, there is no need for this certification, so the product strategy is to use the lower computer WiFi. The hardware configuration is: the industrial computer is pasted with a WiFi module, but the antenna is not installed; 3

Therefore, when this requirement was introduced in January 2022, this bug was generated: from December 2022, all Lindi industrial computers have been pasted with the Bilian WiFi module (this information was communicated and confirmed with the supplier on 2023-6-13).

Causes: 1

At present, the network_manager node is to judge that as long as there are wlan0 and wlan1 devices (as long as the industrial computer motherboard is attached to the WiFi module), the host computer WiFi will be used; this judgment logic only considers whether there is a WiFi module, not whether there is a WiFi antenna;2

For regions other than North America, Japan and South Korea, although the industrial computer is pasted with a WiFi module, but if the host antenna is not installed, these robots will have problems accessing the Internet;3

For robots in North America, Japan and South Korea, the industrial computer has a WiFi module and an antenna, so there is no problem. 

Scope of Impact: This problem occurs in all vehicles shipped outside of North America, Japan and South Korea (these vehicles have a host computer WiFi module but do not have a host computer antenna);

Solution Description (M9-00-7 Version) 1

Add an advanced parameter：/device/network/disable_upper_wifi_
module bool

Default value: true (I learned that only a small number of North America, etc., have antennas, so the version uses the lower computer WiFi by default).

Actions required by the factory: 1

Cancel the technical change action released on 2023-7-22 to block the WiFi of the host computer through WiFi script;2

For versions of M9-00-7, M9-00-8,
Robots in North America, Japan and South Korea are going to be /device/network/disable_upper_wifi_
module bool Configured as: false; 
Robots in North America, Japan and South Korea are going to be/device/network/disable_upper_wifi_
module bool Configured as:true。 

FAE required actions: upgrade the M9-00-7 to M10-00-2 version,
北美日韩地区的机器人要把/device/network/disable_upper_wifi_
module bool配置为false。 3

For versions after M10-00-2, machines in North America, Japan and South Korea do not need to do any operation, and use the host computer WIFI by default Machines from non-North America, Japan and South Korea
/device/network/disable_upper_wifi_
module boolConfigured as:true。 23

Introduced changes related to M9-00-8 overcurrent protection, and added a function to set the lower computer, which can be used to close and restart the relay on the machine on this function page24

3.7 The machine releases the duty cycle limit of the suction motor, which can be adjusted to 100%, and the actual suction effect has been improved to a certain extent, but it does not play a decisive role

hotfix2 does not include battery firmware26

The version number upgrade option is a slip of the tongue - only for 50 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 70 









More than six ems, rest assured to drag directly
Under the six of the em, don't drag it first
The battery technology has been improved, and it is neat and straight
Civilization oh kick alas, the machine does not drag people 27

20230927 update After the on-site shutdown, there will no longer be an alarm popping up when the whole machine is not completed, and the restart will no longer force the relay to disconnect to start the robot, and the function can be used again when the robot is abnormal

Because after the power is off, pushing the robot may cause the hub motor to produce reverse electromotive force, non-M9-00-9, and non-M10-00-3 version, if there is an overcurrent alarm, first shut down, disconnect the empty open, and then push the machine 28

The M9-00-9 and M10-00-3 versions of the damping mode have been turned off, and the machine climbing overcurrent protection no longer exists. .","SOP","Gaussian","S50","M9","","3.7","","Firmware","Engineer","Low","Deprecated","Internal","hotfix","human","0","2025-10-07 19:22:20"

Gausium Robot Scrubber 50 Upgrade Notice 

Dear Agents/Channel Partners:

The Gausium Scrubber 50 cleaning robot has undergone multiple iterations and upgrades to enhance its functionality. Compared 

to the equipment previously delivered to your company, the upgraded version offers improved performance.  Moreover, we adhere to 

the principle of ensuring end-user satisfaction, thus initiating proactive upgrade services for devices within the specified scope.

Upgrade  services  typically  include  software  upgrades  and  replacement  of  components  which  means  local  engineers  from  our 

company will be responsible for providing on-site technical support, operation SOPs, free spare parts support (distributed by Gausium), 

and finally closed-loop management. Furthermore, we kindly request the support of all agents/channel partners in efforts to collectively 

enhance the end-user experience.

This proactive upgrade includes the following:

Software Version Upgrade M10-00-6-20231126: This version focuses on optimizing the following functions: 

a.Optimization of rare occurrences of abnormal tasks and abnormal parking issues, significantly reducing the likelihood of such 

problems. It effectively improves continuous single-task operation duration by more than 50%.

b.In this version, automatic recognition of glass curtain walls, black objects (including black facades), decorative wires, decorative 

carpets, and automatic avoidance during operation are enabled.

c. Resolution of other rare occurrence alert issues.

Battery Charging and Maintenance for Inventory Machines: To ensure a smooth upgrade process and sufficient battery power after 

the upgrade, we will charge the products before and after the version upgrade. This is done to achieve the best storage condition and 

delivery status.

For these upgrades, on-site visits to various end-user locations are required, and we seek strong support from all channel partners. 

For  devices  still  in  warehouses,  however,  upgrades  can  be  implemented  on-site.  We  sincerely  appreciate  everyone's  support  and 

understanding!

""Overview of change"" ""Description of quality/performance/functional differences"" ""1. The squeegee is fixed with a buckle, and supports quick release; 
2. The filter broom supports quick release for earier maintenance; 
3. The width of the filter broom completely covers the squeegee rubber, preventing garbage and hair from entering the squeegee inlet and pipes to cause blockage. In actual using, in an epoxy floor, a large amount of floating garbage was scattered, and the robot is scrubbing for 2 hours without clogging. 90% of the garbage was blocked outside the squeegee by the filter broom;""

Description 

 Background 

Hardware upgrades such as GS40 and GS50 suction motors have affected the lifespan of the motor due 
to abnormal dust entry or blockage of the suction duct due to abnormal large garbage. The new version 
of  the  suction  motor  can  effectively  prevent  dust,  and  when  used  in  conjunction  with  fuses,  it  can 
effectively improve the lifespan of the motor and reduce the frequency of problem repairs.

A brief introduction of Gaussian sensor layout and intelligent algorithms

A brief introduction of

Gaussian sensor layout

and intelligent algorithms

Summary 

Gaussian has rich practical experience in robotics and a profound understanding of application 

scenarios. We have identified two core demands for robots in terms of sensors: Localization and 

obstacle perception. Through our meticulously designed sensor layout as well as our 

intelligent algorithms, even without 3D LiDAR, we can fully meet these two requirements. This 

ensures that robots can operate stably, safely, and efficiently in indoor environments. 

1. Our meticulously designed  sensor layout is combined with 2D LiDAR and multiple 

cameras, which is much more cheap than a 3D Lidar. Still, the robot can comprehensively 

perceive all obstacles in its direction of travel, ensuring operational safety.  

2. With the Automatic Map Update Algorighm,  the robot is able to update the map 

automaticly during daily tasks. This ensure the robot can accurately localize itself with 2D 

LiDAR in all the indoor scenarios, even in some complex and changing environment, such as 

malls or supermakets. 

3. With the Real-time Automatic Coverage Algorithm, the robot can dynamically adapt to 

environmental changes and plan the most optimal cleaning path, enabling the robot work 

with high efficiency. 

Obstacle Perception 

Front Sensor Layout: 

1. Three Depth Cameras: The depth cameras are able to generate a detailed depth image, 

effectively identify and measure the distance and shape of objects ahead. This is crucial for 

recognizing obstacles  in complex environments.  

2. One RGB Camera: The RGB camera captures color images, providing rich visual information. 

Combined with depth information, it can more accurately identify and classify obstacles. 

3. One 2D Planar LiDAR: The 2D LiDAR has a field of view (FOV) of 210 degrees,  providing 

high-precision distance measurement data is a wide range. 

Rear Sensor Layout:

A brief introduction of Gaussian sensor layout and intelligent algorithms

1. One Planar LiDAR: Similar to the front LiDAR, it monitors the rear environment to prevent the 

robot from colliding with obstacles while reversing or turning. 

2. One RGB Camera: Captures color images of the rear, complementing the rear LiDAR data to 

enhance the accuracy of rear environment perception. 

By combining front and rear sensors, the robot can comprehensively perceive all obstacles in its 

direction of travel, ensuring operational safety.

Failed to connect to charging station 
Fixing step: 
Please edit [/strategy/charger_base/straight_path_offset] (Values), If Robot needed to move to left, please change Values ​​to negative, if needed to move to the right, please change ​​to positive. 
If you are not sure where to modify above values, please directly contact to Pae.


Robot can’t automatically recharge after connect to charging station
Cause：The probe and optocoupler switch, charging motherboard, probe and other hardware of workstation or charging pile malfunction
Solution：rostopicecho/device/device_status|grepcharger-a1
Check the voltage and current and whether it is charged or not
When the voltage is detected for 3s, the relay will be closed and generating current after telescopic rod is triggered

Check: charger_status is it charging?
You can check the charger_voltage from here.
You can check the charger_current from here.
Case 1 : Without Voltage and current
Robot will directly exit from charging station, please check the probe and other hardware parts of the station.
Case 2: With voltage but no current
When robot moving forward to detect ”max_try_dis”, if detected electric current and telescopic rod is triggered, then the pairing process is successful.
But if detected no current, robot will try to re-pairing, after 3 times pairing unsuccess, manual pairing is needed.
If there is 7cm offset after the robot is successfully connected to the charging station due to some reasons. FAE could modify the [/strategy/charger_base/expected_finish_dist_to_charger] to lower the distance according to the environment. If there no issue with the distance, then please check the squeegee, maybe the squeegee is not triggered, that cause the relay are not closed, adjust the hardware is needed.
If none of the above problem, please check the hardware.
 
(3)Check workstation whether refill and drain water function of the workstation
Plesae type the command[rostopicecho/work_station_controller/status] to check the status of the workstation.



Auto-docking completed, but robot quit and re-dock for unknown reasons
Solution steps:
rostopic echo /device/all_device_status |grep charger -a1

In normally situation, two items as above should have value, but when the value of current show in 0, which means the charging pad is not touch with robot, Please modify below filed.
[/strategy/charger_base/expected_finish_dist_to_charger] change the value slightly smaller，or [/strategy/charger_base/max_try_dis]change the value slightly bigger。
If the charging pad is touching the robot, but still no current, it may caused by the telescopic rod is not triggered or other parts, Please adjust the telescopic rod and check relevant hardware.


 After scanning the QR code of the charging station, stops moving backward to the pairing.
Solution： Check the TF value of the laser and the rear camera correct or not. Then check the move_base log [tail -f move_base_node-*-**.log] to check it is caused by path unsafe or not. 
You can try to modify the parameter adjustment appropriately [strategy.yaml/charger_base/stop_safe_check_dis]
The range is 0.5 - 0.65.




How to troubleshoot the problem that the robot cannot reserve the charging station
Steps：Ensure Lora module of robot function.
Check the log name [ws75/50_lora.log], If the highlighted area show in following screenshot is shown when the node is started, which means local LORA is opened successfully. But if the log showing [Open/dev/ttyUSB0 FAILED](Actual serial port name may be different),which means serial port can’t be opened, please check the serial port of the local LORA module is it right or not. 

If it is COM port, please check the connection between LORA module and IPC on-site.
Below picture show the COM port of the HengBang IPC.

If needed to check the address of the bounded serial port, please through the USB link: USB serial prot
If it is 50robot please modify the [/dev/ttyS3] to [/dev/yyy]
from the [lora_param.yaml] and [elevator_lora_node.yaml]
[/dev/ttyS3] to [/dev/yyy]
COM port should be [/dev/ttyS0]
3. If using bounded COM port，please refer following rules
　com1 Use [/dev/ttyS0]
　com2 Use [/dev/ttyS1]
Mark sure the documents filled correctly.

63：Position alignment deviation in auto-docking对桩左右对歪
Solution: revise the parameter in /strategy/charger_base/straight_path_offset. Decrease the value to make it turn left for more, increase to make it turn right for more. If you are not clear where to change it (in upper computer, APP, or user config.yaml), please contact with technical support specialist and PAE. 
处理方法：修改/strategy/charger_base/straight_path_offset参数，需要车子向左，
就改负，需要车子向右，就改正如果不清楚是在上位机还是在app还是在
userconfig.yaml里面改，可以直接来问pae


64：Charging doesn’t work after manual or auto docking 
Possible reason: hardware issues, like light-coupled switch, main control board, charging port, etc.
Check the values in APP (voltage, current, if it is charging): “rostopicecho/device/device_status|grepcharger-a1”

When the voltage is detected, light-coupled switch will be triggered to activate the power repay for forming the current.

charger_status: if it is charging 
charger_voltage: voltage of charging 
charger_current: current of charging 
If no voltage & current
Robot will do auto-docking again. Check the hardware like charging ports before auto-docking.
If value of voltage is normal, but no current.
Robot goes forward to measure the distance of “max_try_dis”. Docking succeed and charging activated if light-coupled switch was triggered and current was formed.
If there’s no current, robot will leave charging station and do auto-docking again. Please do manual docking if auto-docking failed for 3 times. 
If the deviation of physical position was over 7cm after docking, charging will not be activated, robot will do auto-docking again.
Decrease the value of “/strategy/charger_base/expected_finish_dist_to_charger“ according to the situation in the field. 
If it is not position and distance issue, it could be the switch of water inlet not be triggered, which makes the power replay not be triggered to activate charging. Therefore, adjust the water inlet rod to proper position. 
If there’s no issue with above points, check the hardware.
If water filling or drain works normally
rostopicecho/work_station_controller/status

65: Auto-docking succeed, but robot leave charging station and redo auto-docking. 
Solution:
rostopic echo /device/all_device_status |grep charger -a1

Normally, the value of voltage and current should not be 0 after docking completed. For the above picture, there is voltage but no current, means the charging ports in robot and charging station have not contacted with each other Increase the value of “/strategy/charger_base/expected_finish_dist_to_charger”, or decrease the value of “/strategy/charger_base/max_try_dis”, then test it again.
If the 2 pairs of charging ports have contacted with each other, but there’s still no current.  It could be the switch of water inlet not be triggered. Adjust the water inlet rod to proper position.


66：Robot moves backward for a distance and stop auto-docking after recognizing the QR code. 
Solution: 
Check if the TF of laser is aligned with the TF of camera.
Check the log of “move_base” (tail -f move_base_node-*-**.log) to see if it is due to the backward path is not safe. Adjust the value accordingly (strategy.yaml/charger_base/stop_safe_check_dis)
Adjustable range: 0.5~0.65.



67. Robot failed to make appointments with workstation or charging pile.
Troubleshooting: check if the lora module (connect with robot) works normally, data connection not lost. 
Log name: “ws75/50_lora.log”, if below red highlighted message shows up, means the local com port of lora is open, lora module has normal data connection with robot. If “Open /dev/ttyUSB0 FAILED” shows up (the actual name of com port various according to different conditions), means failed to open the com port. You need to check if the config of local com port of lora is set correctly. 

For com port, check the connection between lora module and lower computer.

If the connection to lora uses USB cable, check the fixed address of USB com port.(new version, 4th gen lower computer, which equipped with USB ports instead of 232 com port.)

If it is 50恒邦 (old version) lower computer, please revise “/dev/ttyS3” to “/dev/yyy” in “lora_param.yaml” and “elevator_lora_node.yaml”
Below is the picture of com port of 50恒邦 (old version)


3. If to use the com ports in tablet, below is their name:
　Name of “com1” is /dev/ttyS0
　Name of “com2: is /dev/ttyS1
Confirm if the parameter is set properly. 
For the new auto-docking process, it is necessary to modify the files in “public”. Check if “lora_param.yaml”and “elevator_lora_node.yaml”exist in “public”first.
If they exist, follow the settings below to modify the address of workstation and robot in these 2 files, while mark the address with '' 
1. lora_param.yaml
LoraDeviceName: /dev/ttyS3
LoraNodeAdr75: '80ff'
LoraNodeAdrWS: '8009'
LoraDeviceName this field is port of lora, confirm in the field that com port connection has no issues.
LoraNodeAdr75 dialing code of lora in robot
LoraNodeAdrWS dialing code of workstation or charge station
2、elevator_lora_node.yaml
Elevator:
  RelayExis: true
Lora:
  myLoraAddress: '80ff'
  uartPort: /dev/ttyS3
WS50:
  LoraNodeAdrWS: '8009'
name:
- Elevator
- WS50
- GateController
uartPort this field is port of lora, confirm in the field that com port connection has no issues.
myLoraAddress dialing code of lora in robot
LoraNodeAdrWS dialing code of workstation or charge station



68. Lost location in auto-operation
Possible reason: 1. abnormal locating, location lost. 2. Environment variation.

Check:
1.If the place where robot lost location has environment variation.
2.If environment variation cannot be confirmed, push the robot and move it in this environment, and check if the red laser line is the same to the ones in blue map in APP. 
3.If they are the same, download bag, log and ma, escalate the issue to technical support specialist and submit Jira.


69 Fuzzy or ghost image generated during map scanning
Steps：
1. download the information of bag, log and map that generated when fuzzy or ghost image happened. And pass them to technical support specialist, they’ll escalate it and submit Jira.
2. If the map scanning operation followed the official instructions. (Please follow the deployment instruction to scan the map)
3. If laser crashed with something. 


70. Unknown obstacle appears in map scanning 
Possible reason: the position of laser moved, not in original position, which could make the ground be scanned.
Steps：
1.Check if there is alarm about laser in APP. The light indicator of laser is on.
2.Connect robot to Rviz, check if there is noise, if laser scan has deviation that makes laser scan the ground. 
4.Open the little front door, check if the leveling bubble of laser is in the center. Adjust the screw to make the bubble in the center if there is deviation.  
5.calibrate the laser and scan the map again to see if issue was resolved.

71. Alarm message – error in xd510 motor driver 
Possible reason: driver issue
Below is the error code list. Please connect with technical support specialist for assistance when motor driver is in error state.

72. Robot cannot move backward to avoid obstacles.
Possible reason: the “tf” of rear camera in not set properly.
Steps：
1. Use APP tool to calibrate rear camera.
2. calibrate it manually: 
Confirm the config of parameter in the file matches robot’s state (like quantity of QR code, type, side length of QR code), confirm if data of topic is normal 
Push robot to workstation, make the camera 40cm away from QR code, and precisely align charging port of robot to the port of workstation (robot just need to go straight backward when doing auto-docking). Then, check the value of“space”and “length” in “launch/param/qr_parameter.yaml”match the actual situation. “Space” means the distance between the 2 QR code, “length” means the side length of QR code, unit: meter 
vi launch/param/qr_parameter.yaml
Operate in touch screen. Enter file folder “launch/include/”
Start calibration program：roslaunch charger_pose.launch；
Manually publish/push a topic：rostopic pub /qr_detect std_msgs/UInt8 ""data: 1"" 
Monitor topic： /charger_pose/qrToLink. No need to modify If the value of Y & theta is less than 0,015 in most time (occasionally beat is acceptable). If bigger than 0,015, go to next step.
cd launch/include
roslaunch charger_pose.launch
rostopic pub /qr_detect std_msgs/UInt8 ""data: 1"" 
rostopic echo  /charger_pose/qrToLink

Monitor topic：/charger_pose/calibr_pose，copy the value in this topic and paste them into the file “/public/use_camera1_tf.yaml” to overwrite the previous value red highlighted in below picture. 

The “TF” of rear camera stores in “camera1_tf.yaml” in “rostopic echo  /charger_pose/calibr_pose

problems. It effectively improves continuous single-task operation duration by more than 50%.

b.In this version, automatic recognition of glass curtain walls, black objects (including black facades), decorative wires, decorative 

carpets, and automatic avoidance during operation are enabled.

c. Resolution of other rare occurrence alert issues.

Battery Charging and Maintenance for Inventory Machines: To ensure a smooth upgrade process and sufficient battery power after 

the upgrade, we will charge the products before and after the version upgrade. This is done to achieve the best storage condition and 

delivery status.

For these upgrades, on-site visits to various end-user locations are required, and we seek strong support from all channel partners. 

For  devices  still  in  warehouses,  however,  upgrades  can  be  implemented  on-site.  We  sincerely  appreciate  everyone's  support  and 

understanding!

Manufacturer: Shanghai Gaussian Automation Technology Development Co. Ltd  

Product: Autonomous Cleaning Robot 

Model: S1 PRO (PHANTAS), Scrubber 50 Pro 

Background: 

Certain GS models, when navigating and cleaning autonomously, may face challenges in detecting glass doors, 

such as those found on supermarket freezers. This can pose a risk of collision with these doors. 

Current Solutions: 

1.  Framed Glass Doors: 

The risk of collision can be mitigated by updating to the AIO1.2 or later for Phantas, and AIO1.3 for 

SC50. This update enables the Phantas and SC50 models to effectively avoid collisions with framed glass 

doors. 

2.  Frameless Glass Doors: 

To prevent collisions, it is recommended to create virtual walls that block the entire area where frameless 

glass doors may be when opened (refer to the picture below). This should be done regardless of whether 

the doors are partially (20%) or fully (100%) open. 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Future Solutions: 

1.  Frameless glass door: need to paste point-shaped infrared stickers and draw the glass door area, based on 

the upcoming software AIO1.4, which is expected to be released in December 2024. You may contact 

the corresponding regional FAE for stickers and deployment handbook.

Software version
Before deploying the version, confirm the configuration of the sensor_type ultrasound position and set the ultrasound to 0


After the upgrade is completed, modify the app parameters/device/mcu/cancel_ttl_485 to open it, then shut down and restart it





Find the ultrasound signal wire (1 8ping with 4 wire harnesses, 2 on the upper side are ultrasound wire harnesses, follow this wire to find). 
The ultrasound signal wire is not in use and is tied in this position. 
The black terminal does not need to be pulled out and plugged into the lower computer. This diagram is a schematic diagram, and the box shows the ultrasound signal wire. Cut off the white terminal


Weld the wiring harness and ultrasonic signal line according to this diagram, 
weld the wiring harness according to the line markings shown in the diagram, and finally wrap it with insulating tape or shrink it with heat shrink tubing
Finally, tie the wiring harness and restore it.


1. Find the 485 module and ultrasonic communication harness, search for and connect the ultrasonic communication harness; Corresponding update of lower computer program
2. Remove the A and B signal wires from the blue terminals of the 485 module, cut off the ultrasonic 485 communication wire connector, and before deploying the version, confirm the configuration of the sensor_type ultrasonic position and set the ultrasonic position to 0 (14th position - ultrasonic position)
3. The sound line is connected to the lower computer J13 port, and there is a communication harness reserved in the vehicle body. Follow J13 to find it;
4. Connect the A line and ultrasonic 485A line, B line and ultrasonic 485B line on the 485 module; After the docking is completed, update the attached lower computer program. After the upgrade is completed, modify the app parameters/device/mcu/cancel_ttl_485 to open, then shut down and restart.","Drawing","","","","","","","Actuation/Brush","","Medium","Active","Internal","","heuristic","1","2025-10-07 16:32:16"

描述 

吸水扒经过跑车测试后抬升高度会下降，抬升板发生位移翘起，摆臂螺丝已锁紧但还是无法紧固抬

升板。要求抬升高度 45-55，测试跑车后会降低到 30 多。 

After passing the sports car test, the lifting height of the water absorbing scraper will decrease, and the lifting 
plate will shift and lift. The swing arm screws have been locked, but the lifting plate still cannot be 
tightened. Require a lifting height of 45-55, which will decrease to over 30 after testing the sports car. 

在铝挤摆臂与摆臂连接杆之间增加左、右夹板，加强连接强度，避免发生角度偏移导致的吸水扒高

度降低。Add left and right clamping plates between the aluminum extrusion swing arm and the swing arm 
connecting rod to strengthen the connection strength and avoid the decrease in suction height caused by angle 
deviation.

In the hotel scene, there are walls and doors in the hallway of the guest room. The customer hopes that the door can also be cleaned next to	the side.

As can be seen in the video, the recessed position of the doorway is not recognized as a wall line, and it will default to the obstacle boundary, which cannot be edged
Open method
If the current scene is a hotel, then this function should be enabled by default.
If it is not a hotel scene, you need to turn on the item use_virtual_wall_tracking
in Data Management -> Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Robot Configuration -> View Parameters -> strategy -> realtime_auto_cover on the APP, and then you need to restart the machine

Robot configuration Timing configuration
Scene configuration
Please select the actual working scene of the robot, and you can configure and adjust the system parameters with one click.







Drawing a virtual wall
Just draw a virtual wall along the surface of the obstacle you want to paste, or at a depth of no more than 10 cm inside the surface of the obstacle, as shown in the green line in the figure below:




Point 1: Artificial wall line
To coincide with the solid wall to be pasted as much as possible.

Point 2: The virtual wall should be as close to the outside as possible to prevent the robot from turning inside the door and scratching the corner of the wall.

Point 3: SAFE in advanced parameters_ DISTANCE should not be less than 0.04, otherwise there is a risk of collision if it is too close to the wall.





Set the distance from the virtual wall
In the data management on the APP->settings->advanced settings->robot configuration->view
parameters->strategy->realtime_auto_cover, there is an item called safe_distance, which is the distance between the robot shell and the obstacle, the unit is meters, modify this The parameter can adjust the margin distance. Need to restart after modification
Precautions
After the above two parameters are modified, they will be saved in public/user_config.yaml, so the updated version will not return to the default value
The parameter of pasting distance is not only effective for pasting virtual walls, but also for the function of pasting wall lines
Modifying the default welting distance may cause collision and freeze
problems. If you must modify it, please be sure to test it several times. safe_distance should not be less than 0.04. Please be sure to test it several times. Safe_distance should not be less than 0.04
Turning on or off the function of pasting the virtual wall will not affect the function of pasting the wall line, and the two can be used at the same time. If

you want to turn off the wall line function, you need to turn off the wall line detection on the APP
Before performing the welting task on a vehicle for the first time, it is necessary to confirm whether the cleaning equipment is selected correctly. The method of choosing to clean the device is in this document:
""50fusion Switches Footprint Scheme Document According to Cleaning Mode"".
 https://gaussian.yuque.com/docs/share/6a06d2bf-9d9c-4760-9c1e-036f11d3
 afb6?#
""50fusion Switches Footprint Scheme Document According to Cleaning Mode"".

Since the relevant parameters are read from the public first, it may appear that the APP shows that the configuration is correct, but actually loads the wrong parameters in the public. The easiest way to avoid this is to switch the device to another configuration on the APP, and then switch back to the correct configuration, so as to ensure that the parameters are updated. If the parameters have not been manually modified, this operation generally only needs to be performed once on a robot.

Training FAQ
Original wall line or artificial wall line, which one has higher priority? After painting together, which one should I paste?
There is no priority as to which one should be pasted on the original wall line or the artificial wall line.
After the artificial wall line and the original wall line are overlapped and drawn, the machine will always stick to the principle of being farther away from the actual wall, that is, the drawing of the artificial wall line is relatively close to the internal test, and the safe distance of the original wall line is farther from the wall Next, the machine pastes the original wall line; the artificial wall line is drawn on the outside, and the safety distance of the artificial wall line is farther from the wall, the machine pastes the artificial wall line
For the artificial wall line, if only the position of the door is drawn, is it feasible?
--Impossible, some supplements are needed
The ends of the two ends of the artificial wall line segment will not stick to the wall
If you only draw the door, you need to extend the length of at least 0.5m on
both sides of the door
Ensure the continuity of the artificial wall line in the long passage as much as possible to ensure the continuous welt effect

After drawing the artificial wall line, whether the teaching line is still valid take effect
The teaching route is an independent system, which will block the restrictions of other strategies. Regardless of whether artificial wall lines are set, the machine can still clean according to the taught route.
Recording area/line segment
Description of Requirement

Custom area (aware policy shielding) Demand background:
In the hotel scene, there are some glass walls with thin rods. The robot recognizes that the thin rods on the glass walls cannot be aligned,	and will avoid obstacles or shake its head.
In the supermarket scene, if the shelves are close together, the legs of the shelves will be recognized as thin rods, making it impossible to enter.
In the subway car, the robot will recognize the handrail in the subway car
as a thin rod for large expansion, which makes the robot unable to pass.
In the office building or hotel scene, there will be misidentification of the one-meter column, etc.
Functional description
By drawing the area, the robot can also normally weave in some special areas, such as walls with thin rods in hotels, supermarket shelves, handrails, etc.
Turn on the anti-drop detection function in a specific area by drawing an area.
Turn on the one-meter hurdle recognition function in a specific area by drawing the area.
operation method
In the map management, draw the newly added custom area (manual drawing, recording can be used).
After the drawing is completed (area closed), it will automatically jump out of the marquee to select the attributes of the custom area ( multiple attributes can be selected).
After selecting and clicking Confirm, it will automatically jump to the custom attribute switch page (you can reset the switch in the map management after selecting the area and clicking the edit button in the upper right corner) Note: When the switch is turned on, it means that the obstacle avoidance strategies such as ""one-meter hurdle detection, fall prevention, and thin pole

recognition"" are still in effect in this area.
When the switch is turned off, it means that the area is blocked by obstacle avoidance strategies such as ""one-meter hurdle detection, anti-fall, and thin pole recognition"", and the machine can normally stick to the edge in this area.


Parameter configuration
Please select the function that needs to be configured:



















Parameter Configuration:
-One meter hurdle detection
-Anti-drop
-If the switch is set to green, the obstacle avoidance strategy
-continue to take effect

The switch is grayed out, then the obstacle avoidance strategy is shielded, and the robot can stick to the edge normally in this area.
-Sure



3.5. Adaptive adjustment of cleaning width
1. Functional description
 a. When performing real-time automatic coverage or inspection cleaning, the cleaning width is calculated according to the above algorithm:
   i. 40&50 non-scrubbing mode: when performing tasks, the width of the widest cleaning mechanism among the lowered cleaning mechanisms.
   ⅱ. 50 Scrubbing mode: When performing a task, the cleaning width with the highest priority among the cleaning mechanisms that are removed and put down, the priority of the cleaning width is Wd brush > Wd pick > Wd side brush.
 b. The cleaning coverage of real-time automatic coverage and the cleaning area of ​​the task report are calculated using the adaptive cleaning width, and the cleaning area reflects the most real value.
 c. The cleaning coverage of inspection cleaning is calculated according to the cleaning width, and the cleaning area is still calculated according to the field of view coverage.
 d. Automatic coverage does not need to consider the above algorithm, and still uses the original fixed cleaning width.

3.6 Tool APP device control function optimization

The factory comprehensive test and goods inspection link need to check the operation of the robot control equipment. Hope 50 can carry out refined operations for each device according to the factory test process, rather than limited to the equipment control at the business process level. For example, in the business process, several A piece of equipment is coupled, which does not meet the requirements set by the quality center

Cleaning Equipment Control:













Tool APP can configure language and voice

The robot software opens the interface of language and voice configuration for tool app configuration.











Configure the local LORA address of the robot

Functional description
The robot can be configured with a LORA address instead of the original physical address.
configuration method
In which directory is the supplement
LORA configuration:












Training FAQ
The Lora set on the machine, in the case of a system crash or hardware replacement, can the original Lora address of the machine be found again? In non-extreme cases, there are backups:
If the Lora module is damaged, the set parameters are still saved in the all-in-one computer and the host computer.

If the all-in-one machine is damaged, the parameters of the lora module can be queried in the all-in-one machine, and the parameters of the lora module itself will not change.
If the upper computer is damaged, the parameters of the all-in-one
machine and the lora module itself remain unchanged.
If the upper computer and the all-in-one computer are damaged at the same time, the parameters of the lora module itself remain unchanged, and can be read normally after plugging in.
If the upper computer, all-in-one computer, and lora module are
damaged at the same time, the cloud will not save this parameter and cannot restore it. If there is no manual record, you need to reset and re-add peripherals such as workstation charging piles

SOP
1、 Background
The GWMA workstation card is applied to multiple workstations and charging
stations. When applied to different products, the corresponding part number
and the firmware matched with the part number may vary. This SOP will
explain the differences between different part numbers in firmware and
application products.

2、

Main board, part number, product line, corresponding relationship

Board: Currently, GWMA only has one board, which can be divided into two
types based on the main control chip: GWMA-GD chip version and GWMA-ST
chip version. In terms of appearance, generally speaking, ST boards are
produced early without oil cover, while GD boards are produced late, with
some having oil cover and some not.
If the main control chip of the GWMA board can be seen, it can be
distinguished whether it is GD or ST by the wet printing on it. The main control
of the ST board is shown in the following figure:
STM32:

若看不到GWMA板卡主控芯片上的湿印，表面被涂油，不能分辨，则是GD芯片
的（需下载程序字段带GD的程序），如下图： 
If the wet print on the main control chip of the GWMA board cannot be seen,
the surface is coated with oil, and cannot be distinguished, it is the GD chip (a
program with GD in the program field needs to be downloaded), as shown in
